        'All about Saffron and Saffron Scented Fennel & Chickpea Stew Recipe',
      category: 'Cooking',
      content:
        "Like so many people, when I’ve traveled to Spain, I’ve come back with packages of saffron. But recently I met Negar Ajayebi, whose company Baron Saffron is importing the most exquisite organic Persian saffron. The color is incredibly vibrant and the aroma intense and complex. Frankly, it was way better than anything I ever had before. I spoke with Ajayebi to learn more about this exquisite spice and how to use it. \n\nHow did you get into the saffron business?\nIt was a hobby as we cook every day and we use saffron a lot. Persian people grow up with saffron. We came from a culture where daily cooking is the primary job of every family, and saffron is an important ingredient. The best saffron in the world grows in the Persian plateau, and we like to introduce it to people worldwide.\n\nWhat is something that most Americans don't know about saffron?\n\nMost Americans use the threads to add taste, but the point is that you should grind the threads and brew them! It has so many health benefits as well. The use of saffron as a medicinal plant dates back to ancient times, with its reported therapeutic applications ranging from complaints of the eye, skin, respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary tracts, to mood disorders and as a general tonic.\n\nWhat makes Persian saffron so special compared to saffron from other countries?\n\nSaffron, like other flowers, needs a unique climate to grow up well. The geographical parameters in the great Khorasan (the eastern part of Iran and western part of Afghanistan), aka soil, water, and temperature, make it the best place to grow up saffron. This flower needs too much attention, which means a lot of labor costs. So economical parameter is another issue.\n\nCan you explain the lab testing of saffron and grading?\n\nThe standard test for saffron is ISO 3632-2, which clarifies the three characteristics' saffron sample:\n\n • Safranal: This index represents the smell of saffron. The high-quality saffron scores over 40\n\n • Crocin: This shows the color of saffron. Pure and fresh saffron gets over a score of 250\n\n • Picocrocin: This demonstrates the flavor of saffron. If the test has over 80, you can trust it\n\nI think a lot of people like me buy it and use it infrequently. How important is it for saffron to be fresh?\n\nThe fresher, the better! Keeping saffron in a dry and nearly cold place is a must. It should be kept dry and in a closed lid container.\n\nHow do you use saffron, and how much is typically needed per recipe?\n\nThe best way to use saffron is to brew it. Brewing the saffron releases the most aroma and color, and taste. To have a better result, we usually grind the saffron's threads. It practically helps to release its flavor and aroma three times more! The amount of saffron used in the recipes depends on how much you want the taste to be strong and how much you believe in saffron!\n\nYou recommend grinding the saffron and brewing it with ice at room temperature. Why is that?\n\nIt's a traditional way we learned from our ancestors, and that's because we believe precisely like coffee, cold brewing draws the most aroma and color and tastes out of saffron. \n\nSPECIAL OFFER: If you’d like to purchase saffron, Baron Saffron is offering free shipping with the code cookingwithamy. I hope you’ll try this truly exquisite saffron and let me know how you use it in the comments. I can personally attest a very little bit goes a long way. Thanks Negar!\n\n\nSaffron Scented Chickpea and Fennel Stew\n\nServes 4\n\n\nIngredients\n\n2 heads of fennel, chopped, (save the core)\n\n1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1 large onion, chopped (save the peel and scraps)\n\n1 yellow pepper or 5 mini peppers, seeded and chopped\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced \n\n1 can or 1 1/2 cups of cooked chickpeas\n\n1/2 cup orange juice \n\n1 cup of fennel onion broth\n\n1 can of cherry tomatoes (15 ounces)\n\nPinch of saffron \n\n\nInstructions \n\nIn a small saucepan combine the reserved fennel core and onion scraps. Cover with water and simmer to make a broth. Meanwhile, heat a soup pot and add the oil. Gently fry the onion, fennel, and peppers until soft and beginning to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant. \n\nAdd the chickpeas, orange juice, about a cup of the fennel onion broth, the cherry tomatoes and their liquid, and a pinch of saffron. Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until thick and fragrant. Season to taste with salt. Serve with bulgar or rice. \n\nEnjoy!",

      title: 'How to Use Bean and Legume Pasta',
      category: 'Cooking',
      content:
        "Much as I love pasta, I’m not sure it loves me. Last year my carb-heavy comfort food diet led to some weight gain so I looked into low carb pasta as an alternative. There’s a lot out there and I’m still trying different brands and styles, but I thought now would be a good time to share what I’ve learned so far.\n\nPasta with Butternut Squash and Brussels Sprouts\nMy introduction to legume and bean-based pasta was thanks to Barilla. I was lucky because I got to attend a webinar with Barilla’s incredible chef, Lorenzo Boni. I tried his recipe for pasta with butternut squash and Brussels sprouts which I definitely recommend and have now made several times. If you’ve seen his wildly popular (150k+ followers!) Instagram feed you know he’s a master at making all kinds of pasta dishes and that he often eats plant-based meals. I followed up with him to get some tips on cooking with pasta made from beans and legumes.\nPasta made with beans and legumes is higher in protein and so the recommended 2-ounce portion is surprisingly filling. But the texture isn’t always the same as traditional semolina or durum wheat pasta. Chef Boni told me, “The nature of legume pasta makes it soak up more moisture than traditional semolina pasta, so you always want to reserve a bit of cooking water to adjust if needed.” But when it comes to cooking, he says that with Barilla legume pasta you cook it the same way as semolina pasta. “Boil in salted water for the duration noted on the box and you’ll have perfectly al dente pasta.” They are all gluten-free. \n\nChickpea pasta\n\n\nWhen I asked Chef Boni about pairing chickpea pastas with sauce he said, “Generally speaking, I prefer olive oil based sauces rich with vegetables, aromatic herbs and spices. Seafood also pairs well with chickpea options. If used with creamy or tomato-based sauces, keep in mind to always have some pasta water handy to adjust the dish in case it gets too dry.” He added, “One of my favorite ways to prepare a legume pasta dish would be a simple chickpea rotini with shrimp, diced zucchini and fresh basil. The sauce is light enough to highlight the flavor of the pasta itself, while the natural sweetness helps keep the overall flavor profile more appealing to everyone.” I like the Barilla brand because the only ingredient is chickpeas. Banza makes a popular line of chickpea pasta as well although they include pea starch, tapioca and xanthan gum. \n\nEdamame pasta\n\nI tried two different brands of edamame pasta, Seapoint Farms and Explore Cuisine. The Seapoint pasta has a rougher texture than the Explore. With the Seapoint I found the best pairings were earthy chunky toppings like toasted walnuts and sautéed mushrooms. The Explore Cuisine edamame & spirulina pasta is smoother and more delicate, and worked well with an Asian style peanut sauce. I was happy with the Seapoint brand, but would definitely choose the Explore brand instead if it's available.\n\nRed lentil pasta\n\nRed lentil pasta is most similar to semolina pasta. Barilla makes red lentil pasta in a variety of shapes. But for spaghetti, Chef Boni says, “Barilla red lentil spaghetti is pretty flexible and works well with pretty much everything. I love red lentil spaghetti with light olive oil based sauces with aromatic herbs and some small diced vegetables. It also works well with a lean meat protein.” I have to admit, I have yet to try red lentil pasta, but I'm excited to try it after hearing how similar it is to semolina pasta. It is made only with red lentil flour, that's it. It's available in spaghetti, penne and rotini. \n\nPenne for Your Thoughts\n\nDo you remember seeing photos from Italian supermarkets where the shelves with pasta were barren except for penne? I too seem to end up with boxes of penne or rotini and not a clue what to do with them so I asked Chef Boni his thoughts on the subject. He told me, “Shortcuts such as rotini and penne pair very well with all kind of ragouts as well as tomato based and chunky vegetarian sauces. One of my favorite ways to prepare a legume pasta dish would be a simple chickpea rotini with shrimp, diced zucchini and fresh basil. The sauce is light enough to highlight the flavor of the pasta itself, while the natural sweetness helps keep the overall flavor profile more appealing to everyone.” Thanks chef! When zucchini is in season I know what I will try! ",

      title: 'Holi this Year at Braj Bhoomi',
      category: 'Travelling',
      content:
        'Let’s forget about my age-old problem of procrastinating on the editing and writing for a while and just delve ourselves into the many colours of the vibrant Holi festival. Last year was a complete blast and I got to witness the famous Lath Maar Holi at Nandgaon, Uttar Pradesh. The company of a bunch of awesomesauce people and brilliant photographers lifted my spirits to a whole new level, and I couldn’t stop going ga-ga over what I saw and experienced.\n\nThis year was a different story altogether. In spite of trying my level best to travel with this awesomesauce bunch (well, you got to when experiencing this place at this time of the year; it kinda makes you feel safe and secure), I couldn’t get myself to enrol on this colour extravaganza. A blogger friend of mine was coming to India and I just couldn’t miss being there for her on the very first day of India darshan. I showed her around a lot of places around Delhi, made her try some home-cooked chicken curry, paranthas, bread pakoras, gol-gappas and to top all of that, a nice bowl of authentic Rabri Kulfi. After having introduced her to the many flavours and colours of India, I decided to take off to Barsana with a few friends. I was in no mood to miss Holi this year at one of the most amazing places in India. So, here I was sitting in a car that zoomed off in full-swing towards the Radha Rani Temple in Barsana.\n\nThe vibes and aura of the place this time was nothing compared to what I had experienced last year. Wait, there’s a reason to it! We were a day late to the place and the Lath Maar Holi was all played and done with. Great! What a waste of time!\n\nTo not let our spirits down, we took off to Vrindavan to experience the Ghat culture, the famous parikrama attended by thousands of devotees and the first day of darshan at the famous Banke Bihari Temple. To be honest, my experience at the temple was one of the worst I have ever had in my entire life. If you think it was because of the crowd, then you are somewhat right. There’s more to the story, though. An abundance of people intoxicated with god-knows-what pushed and stepped on people creating a stampede-like situation. Stop before you think that I am being a baby about all this. I have had my fair share of crowds living in a country like India. This was something else! I got pushed, groped and hit hard on the back while all I was trying to do was have a good time. All of this escalated to a point where I couldn’t breathe and thought I was going to die. Glad I had a friend along to help me out. It’s because of him and me constantly shouting that I couldn’t breathe, that we were given way out by some people.\n\nEven though I had a pretty bad experience at the temple, I had a nice time bonding with the people whom I travelled with. This fun bunch made me feel safe and secure, and I had a blast just being with them. The boat ride at the Kesi Ghat was also good. I had a nice time sailing over a small stretch of the Yamuna river, because of which I got some pretty rad shots.\n\nThe hilarious part of the day was when we had returned to Delhi and I had to take the metro back home. At the platform and during the entire ride, everyone kept staring at me. It took me a while to realise it’s mostly because of all the colours that I was drenched with and not just my usual weird self. ',

      category: 'Travelling',
      content:
        'One afternoon wandering about an art exhibition, I broke my backpack. Now, this may not seem something big to you. For me, it’s like going through a breakup. The only difference with this being that I couldn’t linger for long over the past memories. The bag had seen many places in India for years, and it was time for it to vanish into oblivion.\n\nSince I was about to take a short trip to the mountains pretty soon, I thought of taking a new backpack buddy along. Now, choosing a good bag for travelling is a task, especially for a person like me. I need to know the teensy-weensy details about the bag – cost, material, weight, how much of my stuff will it store, how can I distribute its weight properly to ease my walking and many other factors. This time though, I trusted the people at Wildcraft and went ahead with their suggestions. They kept my needs in mind and chose the bag that would be great for my weekend explorations. That’s how I narrowed down to the Zephyr Backpack in the colour Camo Green.\n\nBag Specifications and What All Can You Store?\nThe Zephyr is not like your any other backpack in the town. Specifically designed for the working professionals who are always on the go, the bag is structured in such a way that it eases the efforts of the person carrying it to the maximum.\n\nFeatures and Specifications:\n\nDimensions: 18.50″H x 12.50″W x 8.00″D\nCapacity: 31 L to 40 L\nWeight: 1200 gms\nMaterial: Durable Nylon material which is an extra strength fabric and is also water repellant\nLong-lasting YKK Zippers\n2 side mesh pockets for water bottles\nPadded laptop sleeve for a laptop up to 16″\nZippered organiser with a loop for earphones.\nA 3 compartment suspended back system and a metal frame that keeps the bag away from your body, making the weight distribution even. This makes it easier to carry the bag in the heat.\nThe mesh at the back makes the bag extra snug fit and allows the air to flow freely.\nThe weightless suspensions keep the load squarely on the lumbar (hips) rather than the lower back.\nHas an anti-stress design – This technology enables the person to carry the backpack for a longer period of time comfortably\n\nWhat I recommend having used the bag?\n\nStructure and Colour: By the looks of it, the bag looks amazing. Adding to its structure, the colour Camo Green goes perfectly while on a vacation in the hills. In case green is something that you do not fancy, the bag is also available in the colour Blue Vistas and Blue & Orange Latlong.\nCompartments and Storage: The 3 compartments plus a chain pocket on the front make it an efficient bag that can store a lot of your stuff. There is a separate compartment for your laptop and charger, that too in the middle to keep it secure and balance the weight. The two side mesh pockets for water bottles are made of good quality material and would hold the bottles intact.\nOne slight thing though – The last compartment of the bag (the one facing the back) has less storage space because of the metal back of the bag. The rest are good enough to store ample amount of belongings.\nWeight: Talking about the bag’s weight (1200 gms), it seemed a little heavy for my use. I suppose this is because of the metal back in the bag. Also why it is difficult to make this bag sit tall on the ground. It always leans forwards. Unless, if you have stuffed the bag well, it would sit straight. Although this would solve the issue at hand, it would increase the bag’s weight.\nStraps and Chains: Every portion of the bag is made of good quality materials, making it sturdy and strong to carry almost any type of items. The straps are long and strong enough and the chains are of super quality, hence, easy to open and close using a single hand.\nThere are extra straps for the user’s chest and waist. I guess these help reducing the weight pressure on one’s lower back and direct it towards the lumber (hips). Even though these straps seem helpful, I am not comfortable using them; It makes my chest and body feel restricted while walking, especially hiking. This reason led to me loosening up the shoulder straps, which thereby, made my shoulders feel the bag’s weight even more prominently.',

      category: 'Coding',
      content:
        'Over the past two years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally reshaped software development workflows. Paradigms like Agentic Coding now allow developers to rapidly generate repo-level code from high-level directives, significantly accelerating development velocity. However, a growing sentiment in the developer community characterizes this shift as the rise of the "AI Cleanup Engineer": while Agentic Coding can swiftly automate the initial 80% of a task, the remaining 20%—involving logical calibration, boundary handling, cross-module coordination, and engineering refinement—often requires manual human intervention.\n\nDespite this evolution, traditional code completion tools remain confined to the Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) paradigm. These models typically operate by predicting a contiguous code span at the cursor position based solely on local context, lacking a holistic understanding of editing intent. This single-step, static approach falls short in real-world scenarios—such as multi-line modifications, function refactoring, or cross-file dependency adjustments—and fails to support coherent, structured sequences of development actions.\n\nTo address this limitation, we introduce an end-to-end framework built on three pillars:\n\nCold-start training via precise simulation of real-world edit trajectories using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs);\n\nA data flywheel that captures editing behavior from high-exploration deployments of prototype models; and\n\nActionRL, a novel preference alignment algorithm that ensures deep alignment with developer intent at the level of sequential decision-making.\n\nBreaking Free from FIM: Edit Trajectory Simulation via AST Parsing\nTraditional FIM training typically involves randomly masking spans of code and prompting the model to reconstruct them. While effective for simple completion, this method captures only the static probability distribution of code, not the dynamic logic of software modification.\n\nQoder NEXT moves beyond random masking. Instead, we leverage Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to reverse-engineer realistic edit trajectories, enabling the model to learn how edits unfold—not just what the final code looks like..',

We’ll focus on user experience by incorporating features such as a collapsible sidebar for chat history, smooth transitions between dark and light modes, and automatic conversation saving.\n\nWhy Build a Gemini AI Chatbot with React.js?\nBuilding this AI chatbot teaches you way more than just chatbot development. Here’s what you’ll learn along the way:\n\nReact Components: Work with functional components, JSX, and manage state using hooks. The building blocks of React.\nAPI Integration: Connect to the Gemini API and handle asynchronous requests and responses easily.\nTheme Switching: Let users toggle between dark and light modes using simple state management and clean CSS.\nLocal Storage: Save chat histories in the browser so conversations stick around even after a page refresh.\nPortfolio Project: Add a polished project to your portfolio that shows off your React and API skills.\nIf you’d rather build the same Gemini AI chatbot in vanilla JavaScript, feel free to check out my previous blog post on how to create a Gemini AI chatbot in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a great option if you want to start with the basics and don’t want to dive into React just yet.',

        'From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.\n\nThis is already playing out across teams. For example:\n\nIn operations, AI-powered tools (Celonis, UiPath Process Mining, ServiceNow AI Ops, Signavio, etc.) tackle which work reduces cycle time and cost.\nIn marketing, AI-driven attribution tools (HubSpot, Adobe Sensei, Marketo, etc.) show which campaigns truly drive revenue.\nIn finance, AI-enabled platforms (Anaplan, Workday Adaptive Planning, BlackLine, Planful) automate reporting and forecasting.\nIn customer support, AI-powered tools (Zendesk, Intercom Fin, Gong, Ada) handle repetitive tickets and streamline customer communication workflows.\nAs AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.\n\nAI adoption beyond automation: the transparency tool reshaping roles and processes\nAn overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.\nIn particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIt makes spending explainable. Since AI connects costs to actual usage and outcomes, spending can be traced to specific tools, teams, or processes. This means spending decisions no longer have to be based on assumptions.\nInefficiencies become hard to hide. Duplicate tools or bloated, effort-heavy processes surface quickly when cost and outcomes are analyzed together. As a result, businesses can efficiently eliminate redundant tools or processes and reallocate resources accordingly.\nIt makes runway a competitive advantage. Clear spend visibility and AI-powered insights help companies move faster with less burn.\nUltimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.\n\nSmart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.',

        'Apple buys “Silent Speech” AI startup for $2B, because talking is so 2025',

        'Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014. \n\nBut check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.\n\n​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.\n\nQ.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.\n\nPatents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library. \n\nThat future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.\n\nLongtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.” \n\nAt first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.\n\nYet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.\n\nThis move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself. \n\nThere’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.\n\nIt’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.\n\nIf this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.',

      content:
        'The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.\n\nAccording to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.\n\nThe European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).\n\nA study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.',

        'What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing. \n\nThe broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones. \n\nThis goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.\n\nEurope’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful. \n\nThis apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.\n\nFragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area. \n\nPolicy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness. \n\nFor 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing. \n\nThis support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans. \n\nCalls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.\n\nThat’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.\n\nSo what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?\n\nThey’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.\n\nIf this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.',

      content:
        'There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews. \n\nIn early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee. \n\nIt’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows. \n\nOpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads. \n\nThe company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space. \n\nThe launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features. \n\nSo what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters. \n\nSeen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.
